# Odin-Practice-Webpage

This is my solution to the Odin Project "Landing Page" assignment.

I'm overall pretty pleased with the results, but I'm sure I can clean up code in a lot of ways.  Then again, getting functional first is a good step and I can work on refining my technique as I learn.

I did struggle a bit with some line spacing elements and wish I could do them better.
